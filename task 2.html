            Over a fifth of the Earth’s surface is covered in desert landscapes. 
            Deserts are places that receive less than 25 centimetres of rain per
             year. Contrary to popular belief, deserts are not always hot. Though
              the Sahara Desert in Africa reaches up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit by
               day, mountainous and polar landscapes can be deserts too. An area is
                classified as a desert depending on how dry it is, not its temperature.
                You may have seen them in cartoons or westerns, without much of an idea 
                of what they are.
